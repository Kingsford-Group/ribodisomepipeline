Description:
Sequencing libraries data from CWRU.  These data come from libraries generated by Pieter Spealman and Gemma May.  
They are all from S. cerevisiae S288C. For this set, we attempted to remove the rRNA from the RPF samples before
running them on a gel for size selection.  We also added a 10 nucleotide ID to each fragment before PCR to examine 
how PCR bias affects codon usage analyses.  The PCR ID (SWSWSWSWSW) is incorporated in the reads as follows 
(RPF part)(3’-adapter)(SWSWSWSWSW)(ILLUMINA…).

This set used Q5 PCR polymerase.  

1) - Sac cer. 0 cycloheximide ~22 nt RPF (Lib-5-5-15_1_ACAGTG_R1.fastq.gz)
2) - Sac cer. 0 cycloheximide ~26-32 nt RPF (Lib-5-5-15_2_AGTTCC_R1.fastq.gz)
3) - Sac cer. 0 cycloheximide ~60 nt (potential disomes) RPF (Lib-5-5-15_3_CACGAT_R1.fastq.gz) 
4) - Sac cer. 0 cycloheximide - total RNA (not RPF). (Lib-5-5-15_4_GTAGAG_R1.fastq.gz)
5) - Sac cer.10x cycloheximide ~22 nt RPF (Lib-5-5-15_5_GTCCGC_R1.fastq.gz)
6) - Sac cer. 10x cycloheximide ~26-32 nt RPF (Lib-5-5-15_6_TCCCGA_R1.fastq.gz)
7) - Sac cer. 10x cycloheximide ~60 nt (potential disomes) RPF (Lib-5-5-15_7_ATCACG_R1.fastq.gz)
8) - Sac cer. 10x cycloheximide - total RNA (not RPF). (Lib-5-5-15_8_CGATGT_R1.fastq.gz).

Note: The rRNA removal (by RNaseH) didn't appear to work very well, as the samples were >80% rRNA.
